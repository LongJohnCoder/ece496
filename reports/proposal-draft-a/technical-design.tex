\section{Technical Design}

\subsection{Design Alternatives}

% In this section, you explore and discuss different possible solutions and design
% alternatives. Exploring possibilities is often neglected by designers eager to start on the
% first idea that comes to mind. Often, however, the first solution isnâ€Ÿt the best. For
% instance, you may have in mind an implementation using a keyboard, but when you work
% back to the requirements you may realize that it is only the user control aspect that is
% required, and thus you can do it all from the attached personal computer. The key to
% designing is coming up with alternatives, and it is in exploring alternatives that you come
% to appreciate the inevitable design trade-offs that you will face.
% 
% DO NOT ESTABLISH A DESIGN CHOICE, AND THEN THINK ABOUT
% ALTERNATIVES JUST TO GET THIS DOCUMENT DONE.
% 
% Some alternatives may differ only in small variations in implementation, others may be
% quite different. You should provide enough of an evaluation of each choice to justify your
% selection of the proposed solution. Provide a preliminary assessment of the different
% design alternatives in terms of the project goal and requirements you've laid out. Create a
% comparison table if necessary [See Design Notes, Chapter 9 for more ideas].
% 
% You may find that this section and the next naturally collapse into a single section, or that
% you wish to keep them separate.

Implemenation medium:
\begin{enumeration}
\item Custom integrated circuit \
	\begin{itemlist}
		\item Faster, smaller and more power efficient.
		\item High design and manufacturing costs.
		\item Once built, the parameters can't be modified.
		\item Inputs and outputs will require extra circuitry to interface with the circuit.
	\end{itemlist}
\item Overlay FPGA implemented on commercial FPGA \
	\begin{itemlist}
		\item Researchers may already own an FPGA so they won't need to purchase new hardware.
		\item Need to pick an FPGA platform to target:
		\begin{enumeration}
			\item Basic FPGA without using architecture-specific features
				\begin{itemlist}
					\item Circuit will work on most FPGAs from most vendors, so it is accessible for the most people.
					\item Can't use architecture-specific features to save area and gain performance.
				\end{itemlist}
			\item Xilinx Virtex 5+ \
				\begin{itemlist}
					\item Lookup tables can be programmed directly as 32-bit shift registers.
					\item Large FPGA will fit more logic blocks.
					\item Higher cost for researchers.
				\end{itemlist}
			\item Xilinx Spartan 6 \note{double check} \
				\begin{itemlist}
					\item Lower cost.
					\item \note{check for SRL64}
				\end{itemlist}
			\item Altera Stratix 4 
				\begin{itemlist}
					\item Higher cost.
					\item \note{check for something similar to SRL64}
				\end{itemlist}
		\end{enumeration}
	\end{itemlist}
