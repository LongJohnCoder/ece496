\section{Group Progress Summary}

% - A summary of the project goal and any changes to the goal or requirements since the
%   design review. A system-level diagram is often helpful. Be brief here since you will also
%   provide an updated copy of the complete project goal and requirements in Appendix B.
% - A summary of the group's progress. Highlight a few key accomplishments since the
%   design review. Briefly describe some of the key challenges that were encountered and
%   some of the key decisions that were made in this time. Is the group on schedule? Make
%   explicit reference to the milestones on the original Gantt chart from the Project Proposal.
% - The key responsibilities of each team member since the design review. One or two items
%   for each member is sufficient, and can be general areas instead of tasks.
% - A summary of any changes to the group work plan, individual responsibilities, or the
%   project milestones. Again, be brief here since you will provide the details in Appendix A.
