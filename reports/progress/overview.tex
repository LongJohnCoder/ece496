\section{Project Overview}

% The intent of this section is to re-introduce the reader to the project. It may be largely crafted
% from previous work if the project has not changed much from the proposal, although it may
% contain details of decisions made since the proposal. As it will set the stage for your progress
% descriptions, you might also want to include information about the main design challenges of
% your project. It must at least create the stage for the individual reports so the relevance of the
% individual work is apparent.
% It is expected that details pertinent to the individual progress will be in the documents from those
% individuals.
% If it makes sense, combine this section with the group progress summary. This section should
% NOT be as detailed as in your Proposal, and may use your Proposal as a reference.
