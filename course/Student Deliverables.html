           The design process in ECE496 is marked by 3 key milestones, the Design Review, the Progress Report,
           and the Design Fair. The course deliverables support these three milestones.

              <li>performance graded on a group and individual basis by both supervisor and administrator </li>
              <li>final grade is individually assigned and equally weighted between the supervisor and administrator </li>
           </ul> 
 
         <BR>
          You must submit written work in both written and electronic form. 
          The electronic form format is PDF. A second printed copy may be required
          if requested by your supervisor.

         <BR>
         <BR>
         The purpose of submitting an electronic copy is as follows:
         <ul>  
           <li> 
               it allows the course administrators and supervisors to look back at your
                previous work just in case we feel that you have distorted the truth,
           </li>
           <li> it allows us to archive all of the written deliverables and make them available to future students,</li>
           <li>
                it allows supervisors to access past reports in case hardcopy or electronic
                versions of personally archived reports go missing or are accidentally deleted,
           </li> 
           <li> it allows those administrators that are more comfortable annotating documents electronically to do so.</li>
         </ul>

        <BR>
        The purpose of submitting the hardcopy is as follows: 
        <UL>
          <LI>
              for some people, a hardcopy is easier to read and easier to annotate.
              Also, working with a hardcopy is more time efficient for some people. 
              There is no definitive proof for either of these two statements. 
              Finally it comes down to a matter of preference. In summary, a majority 
              of people still prefer working with a hardcopy so we are maintaining this standard.
          </LI>
        </UL>

        <BR>
        Preparation: 
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          Each student will be expected to have an engineering log book. 
          This need not be elaborate or expensive (a spiral-bound soft covered notebook would do well). 
          Some supervisors may insist on seeing what you have achieved on a weekly basis and your log book 
          will be a good starting point for your weekly activity summary. In it you will keep notes, ideas,
          draft sketches, etc. Try to date each entry. 
          These notes will be invaluable when you come to produce your deliverables.
        </BLOCKQUOTE>

           <br>
             Each of these deliverables is described in detail in its own section under 'Students' ->'Course Deliverables' on the main menu.
